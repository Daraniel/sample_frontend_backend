# Simple Frontend Backend

This project is a sample web application built with Flask backend and React frontend.

It allows accessing data from the provided data source (default: excel data file) and accessing various tables on it.

It mainly focuses on creating a relatively generic and easy to extend backend and allows adding a new API endpoint for
each table in a single line. It also auto creates Swagger for the api.

A frontend is provided to allow accessing/viewing the data.

Please refer to the documentation at []() for more info about the project.
